Create a 3d game with autonomous agents, that move AI-Controlled around the playing field. The player must reach the destination point without running into too many agents. On collision with agents, health points get subtracted from agents. When health == 0, the agents die. The game ends when player health == 0 or when player reaches endzone.

Must use:
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation

Object hierarchy

- Playing Field
- Agent > Player
- Agent > Enemy > Enemy1,2,3
- Agent > Neutral

Agents:
fields
- health points 0-100 (protected)
- deal out damage points (0-30)
- speed (1-10)
- movement pattern (array of GameObjects as targets)
methods
- get damaged
- move, default implementation is using AI

Player:
- move is controlled by user

Enemy:
- inflicts damage on collision

Enemy1,2,3:
- varying number of damage points
- varying velocity
